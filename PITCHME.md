#### A background behind the problem

- Curing a disease normally entails using any of the two approaches- Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines.
- Both the approaches have their own problem
- Pharmaceutical drugs take a lot of time to enter the phase where they could be good for human consumption.
- Vaccines require special conditions for storage and maintainance.

#### Solution

- Make use of anti-microbial peptides!
- Anti-microbial peptides are special class of peptides synthesized from various organisms like bees, frogs etc 
and are are potent drug candidates against microbial organisms such as bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses.
- Anti-microbial peptides are easier to synthesize in a lab environment and do not require specialized equipment for storage.
- Are effective against most anti-microbials like E.Coli.
- Research has shown that they are also effective against diseases like [HIV-1](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0045208) and [Malaria](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579399009643)

#### Problem Objectives

- Extract data required for classification from online webservers and databases.
- Study various Machine Learning algorithms and the effect on the dataset.
- Develop a web-application and/or open-source software.
- Solve the problem of multilabel classification of AMPs since a peptide can act against multiple types of microbes.

#### Problem approach

- We start by extracting data on AMPs from databases like [CAMP](http://www.camp.bicnirrh.res.in/) and APD3(http://aps.unmc.edu/AP/main.php).
- Calculate features for the peptide data, which will be used for classification. 
- Pick a classifier and evaluate results on the classifier
- Create a webserver based on the best Machine learning model picked on the basis of evaluation metrics.
