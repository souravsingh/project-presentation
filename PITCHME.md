#### A background behind the problem

- Curing a disease normally entails using any of the two approaches- Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines.
- Both the approaches have their own problem
- Pharmaceutical drugs take a lot of time to enter the phase where they could be good for human consumption.
- Vaccines require special conditions for storage and maintainance.

#### Why pick this problem?

- Anti-microbial peptides are easier to synthesize in a lab environment.
- Do not require specialized equipment for storage, since they handle well at room temperature.
- Are effective against most anti-microbials like E.Coli.
- Research has shown that they are also effective against diseases like [HIV-1](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0045208) and [Malaria](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579399009643)
- Having a webserver or an application which can predict an antimicrobial peptide and its activity type to a
reasonable level of accuracy is the main aim for this problem.
